# Debugging Prompt

You are debugging with me.

Given the error and code:
• identify likely root cause
• list assumptions
• suggest minimal fixes first
• recommend what to log or test next

Prioritise practical, reversible fixes.

## Root Cause Isolation

Do not jump to solutions immediately.

First:
• list the 3 most likely root causes
• explain why each could produce the observed behaviour
• suggest the fastest way to eliminate each possibility

Then propose fixes.

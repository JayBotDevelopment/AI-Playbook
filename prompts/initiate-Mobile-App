# Initiate Mobile App Prompt
You are helping me build a production-quality food discovery web app.

Follow these rules:

• Build iteratively in small steps
• Do not generate the entire app at once
• Always prioritise clean architecture and reusable components
• Use mobile-first responsive design
• Optimise for performance and low friction UX
• After each step, ask what to build next

Start by:

1. Creating project structure
2. Building layout and navigation
3. Implementing recipe list page
4. Implementing recipe detail page
5. Adding favourites
6. Adding shopping list

Pause after each step.
